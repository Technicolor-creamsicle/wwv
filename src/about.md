# What is this?
This site attempts to emulate the audio portions of stations WWV and WWVH. This is _only_ an
emulation, using your computer's time and samples of the audio. It is in no way a rebroadcast of the
real stations.

# Why??
While the number one reason has to be nostalia, I do genuinely like the _sound_ of WWV. I first
heard WWV (and sometimes WWVH) on a ham radio in my early teens and though it was pretty neat. I
liked the old-timey timbre of the voice announcement on AM, and I'd even turn it on sometimes while
try to do homework since the rhythm of the pulses and changing tones made nice background noise.

NIST has had a telephone service version of the broadcast for a long time, but they've never
streamed it over the internet. Creating a faux-WWV website has been on my someday/maybe project list
for at least a decade, but it got pushed near the top thanks to the threat of WWV being shuttered
for good, after nearly 100 years of service. That depressing prospect (saving a whole $6M), along
with some time over the holidays, prompted me to build reasonable-sounding copies of WWV and WWVH.

You can find samples of WWV lots of places, but this site tries to accurated mimic the pulses, tones
and announcements the will be played and any time of the day. While I hope WWV doesn't get shut
down, at least I feel I've done what I reasonable could to preserve the sound of it while it's still
on the air.

# It doesn't work on my phone/tablet
It's true ðŸ˜¢. Javscript isn't my area of expertise to begin with, and this was the first time I've
used any HTML5 audio APIs at all. I learned late in development that the APIs on mobile are a bit
more restrictive, and the audio clip scheduling scheme that works well on desktop isn't
mobile-friendly at all.

It would be nice if it worked, but it's also quite a bit of work for white is probably a very tiny
audience. If there is interest, I'll dig into fixing this.
